# ❓ What is this?
This project aims to port the Jigsaw block from Java edition into Bedrock. The current system we have for Bedrock is very powerful on its own & reflects a large portion of the Java system. Please keep in mind that not all features from the Java system are available for Bedrock.

# ❗ Where can I get help/track the project?
If you're experiencing trouble, we encourage you to join our discord server or make an issue here on Github.

# 📩 How do I download this/apply to my pack?
Coming soon...

# 🙌 Thank You Contributors!
Thank you, OuterCloud & KekeCreations for making this project possible.
